    <h2>Football</h2>
    <p>
        Football is my favourite hobby. It's a team sport, in which you can score only by<br> placing the ball inside
        the goal of the opposite team. Teams content 11 players–<br>
        field players and a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper's role is to protect the goal.<br>

    <h2>Chess</h2>
    <p>
        Chess is one of the oldest and most popular board games. It is played by two opponents<br> on a checkered board
        with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours,<br> commonly white and black. The objective of the game
        is to capture the opponent's king.

    <h2>Travelling</h2>
    <p>
        “My favourite hobby is travelling because I love discovering new cities and places<br> around the world. I often
        save up for months to plan a trip every year.<br> I love friends' trips and family outings but solo travelling
        brings me<br> the real adventure and thrill to venture into new places all by myself.”

    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>
        I think drawing is the best hobby. You can create art anywhere as long as you have two<br> things: pencils and
        paper. It's good to start at a young age because it gives you a chance to start<br> using your brain and to be
        creative. Also, it is an opportunity to challenge thinking skills<br> and develop learning skills.
